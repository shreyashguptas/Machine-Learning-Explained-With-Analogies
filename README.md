# Creators Note
Learning concepts like Machine Learning and Deep Learning is hard. All the tehcnical jargon can get overwhelming. There are thousands of resources out there and all are good but each has a different way of teaching and you have to know what your best way of learning is. For us it is learning with Analogies. Only when the most complex topics are explained with analogies is when we learn and we believe that there are others who also want that way of learning. That is why we created this. Each topic will have an analogy to each. The smallest things will have an easy explanation on why we are doing what.
This repository will always be opensouce so if there is something that you didn't understand then feel free to create a new issue on the respository pointing out the exact issue. But this course is best learned paired with an AI Chat. We use Perplexity where when we get stuck we ask it questions. We ask it to teach us with analogies and we would recommend you do the same whenever you feel stuck. One of the best resources of our times.

If doing a course like this does not work for you and you are more of a visual learner then you can look at this course created by Amazon - https://mlu-explain.github.io/

## Introduction
This repository is all about how I started learning deep learning using PyTorch at the very basic level. It's very hard for me to understand concepts by just reading the definition. So this repository is going to be all about how I use analogies. I use AI to use analogies to learn certain topics and all of those topics analogies that I liked and helped me understand. I'm going to use those and put those in this repository so anyone can learn deep learning like a dummy. I am a dummy when it comes to learning these things and this repository has helped me learn and I've created this from scratch using the course from DataCamp called Introduction to Deep Learning with PyTorch and other sources as I move forward on building this repository.

I'll be updating this repository with notes, code examples, and projects inspired by the course content, providing a practical, hands-on approach to understanding machine learning concepts.

## Topics Covered

### Machine Learning
- [Linear Regression](./notebooks/supervised-learning/05_linear_regression.ipynb)
- [Batch & Stochastic Gradient Descent](./notebooks/supervised-learning/06_batch_and_stochastic_gradient_descent.ipynb)
- [Normal Equations](./notebooks/supervised-learning/07_normal_equation.ipynb)

### Deep Learning
- [Introduction to PyTorch](./notebooks/01_introduction_to_pytorch.ipynb)
- [Building Neural Networks](./notebooks/02_building_neural_networks.ipynb)
- [Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)](./notebooks/03_convolutional_neural_networks.ipynb)
- [Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)](./notebooks/04_recurrent_neural_networks.ipynb)

Note: We are not going to learn about the Mathematical formulas in this course. All this repo teaches you is the fundamental conceptual theories and then writing code to execute those fundamental topics.
