# Introduction to Machine Learning for Dummies ðŸ§ 

It is overwhelming to learn Machine Learning and Deep Learning. This course explains Deep Learning concepts using real life examples and analogies with practical code examples.

## Why This Course? ðŸ¤”

Learning Machine Learning and Deep Learning can be tough. While there are many great resources out there, we believe the best way to learn is through:
- Simple analogies that relate to everyday life
- Clear explanations of why we do what we do
- Hands-on coding examples
- No complicated math (just the essential concepts)

## What Makes This Course Different? ðŸ’¡

- **Everything explained with analogies**: Complex topics broken down using real-world examples
- **Beginner-friendly**: No prior Machine Learning/Deep Learning knowledge needed
- **Learn by doing**: Practical code examples and exercises
- **AI-assisted learning**: Recommended use of AI chat tools (like Perplexity) when stuck

## How do I know this is the right course for me?
- Do you learn better by taking real life examples to explain a concept?
- Do you learn better by having a good balance of theory and practice?
- Do you learn better when there are no complicated math equations?

If you answered yes to all of the above then this course is for you!

## Do I need to know Python? 

Yes you need to know the basics of Python. If you are new to Python I recommend you take this course: [30 Days Of Python](https://github.com/Asabeneh/30-Days-Of-Python)

## Do I need to know Machine Learning? 

No, but it helps.

## How can I get the most out of this course? 

1. Go through each module and its chapters one by one.
2. If you see a 'Google Colab' icon at the top of the notebook then click on te rocket icon at the top right of the notebook to open it in Google Colab. This will allow you to run the code in the chapter on Google's servers. All the libraries are already installed so it makes it easier to run the code.
3. If you get stuck on a concept then use the AI chat tools like Perplexity to get a better understanding of the concept. 
4. If you think you have found an error in the course or have a suggestion to improve the course then create a new issue in [this repository](https://github.com/shreyashguptas/Machine-Learning-for-Dummies).
5. Make sure to run the code yourself. Sometimes it is helpful to add a new codeblock below the existing codeblock and type the code yourself. This helps you understand the code better. Trust me that is how I learned a lot of the code.

## Can I contribute to this course? 

Yes we would love that! This is an open-source project!

Feel free to:
- Suggest better analogies
- Add new examples
- Fix errors
- Share your learning experience


Remember: Everyone learns differently. If this approach doesn't click with you, that's okay! Check out other resources like MLU-Explain for visual learning.
